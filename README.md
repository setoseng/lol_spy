Lol Spy
A League of Legends web app that will allow the user to search a summoner's name or champion and see detailed for that particular search. Searching summoner name will result in their match history with the champions they played and item build while searching champion name will result in a list of matches with that champion, the item build, and the summoner (in most case a pro player) who played that champion.
